# Widely
Code and data for an upcoming research paper, which searches for types of primes similar to widely digitally delicate primes.

Digitally delicate primes have the property that changing any digit results in a composite number.

Non-insertable primes have the property that inserting any digit in-between two digits, or before and after the number (excluding a leading zero) results in a composite number.

I define a digitally immutable prime as being both digitally delicate and non-insertable. These definitions can be expanded to widely digitally immutable, widely digitally delicate, and widely non-insertable by considering replacing or inserting into any leading zeros.
